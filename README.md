# Public_API_Request
 Fifth Full Stack JavaScript Techdegree Project

The focus of this project was to write JavaScript that would retrieve data from the random user API, parse the data, use the data to create twelve random employees, build an employee directory, and add search and modal interactivity.

The main highlights of this project are the search function as well as the modal event handlers. The search allows a user to filter the employee directory by name. Employee cards are clickable and clicking on a card opens up a modal window with furthur employee details. The next and previous buttons respond to filtered results so that only filtered employees have viewable modals.
